# QRyptEye - Air-Gapped Secure Messaging

End-to-end encryption built into secure messaging apps is great. But what if your endpoint is compromised, ala Pegasus? QRyptEye is an Android application designed for secure, air-gapped messaging using QR codes. The app is intended for installation and use on a secondary, offline-only device. It ensures that plain text messages never touch an exposed device, providing an additional layer security for sensitive communications. 

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Model

### Air-Gapped Communication
- **Offline Device**: QRyptEye runs on a device that is never connected to the internet
- **QR Code Transfer**: Encrypted messages are transferred to an online device by taking a photo of the QR code generated by QRypteye
- **No Plain Text Exposure**: Plain text messages are never exposed to the primary device that touches the internet

### Cryptographic Implementation
- **Hybrid Encryption**: Uses RSA-2048 for key exchange and AES-256 for message encryption
- **Key Management**: Secure generation and storage of cryptographic key pairs
- **BouncyCastle**: Industry-standard cryptographic library for robust security

### Digital Signatures and Authentication
- **Message Signing**: All encrypted messages are digitally signed using RSA-2048 with SHA-256
- **Authenticity Verification**: Recipients can verify that messages came from the claimed sender
- **Tamper Detection**: Any modification to the encrypted message will cause signature verification to fail
- **Non-Repudiation**: Senders cannot deny sending messages they have signed
- **Trust-on-First-Use**: Initial key exchange follows a trust-on-first-use model without digital signatures

## üîÑ Workflow

### Adding a Trusted Contact
1. **Generate Keys**: Each user generates RSA key pairs on their offline devices
2. **Share Public Key**: User creates a QR code containing their public key and name
3. **Transfer**: User photographs the QR code with their online device
4. **Send**: QR code image is sent via any chosen method (email, messaging, etc.)
5. **Import**: Recipient scans the QR code on their offline device to add the contact
6. **Secure**: Private keys never leave the offline device

### Sending a Message
1. **Compose**: User writes a plain text message on the offline device
2. **Encrypt**: QRyptEye encrypts the message using the recipient's public key (exchanged when adding a contact)
3. **Generate QR**: App creates a QR code containing the encrypted message
4. **Transfer**: User photographs the QR code with their online device
5. **Send**: QR code image is sent via any chosen method (email, messaging, etc.)

### Receiving a Message
1. **Receive**: User receives the QR code image on their online device
2. **Transfer**: QR code is scanned by the offline device using the camera
3. **Decrypt**: QRyptEye decrypts the message using the user's private key
4. **Read**: Plain text message is displayed on the offline device

### Build Steps
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Sync Gradle dependencies
4. Build the project
5. Install on target device

### Build Commands
```bash
# Clean build
./gradlew clean

# Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Build release APK
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

### Key Components
- **CryptoManager**: Handles encryption, decryption, and key management
- **QRCodeManager**: Manages QR code generation and parsing
- **Data Models**: Contact, Message, and KeyPairData classes
- **UI Activities**: ComposeMessage, ScanQR, and KeyManagement activities

## üîí Security Considerations

### Best Practices
1. **Never connect the offline device to the internet**
2. **Keep private keys secure and never share them**
3. **Verify QR codes visually before scanning**
4. **Use strong, unique passwords for device protection**
5. **Regularly update the app for security patches**

### Limitations
- **QR Code Size**: Large messages may require multiple QR codes (426 character max per QR code)
- **QR Readability**: Poor camera quality, lighting conditions, or glare may affect QR code scanning
- **Physical Security**: Device must be physically secure
- **Trust-on-First-Use Model**: No authenticity checks occur during initial key exchange. For maximum security, perform initial key exchange in person.
